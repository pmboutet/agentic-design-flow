# Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation - Complete ✅

## Status: Successfully Applied

Migration **014_enable_rls_security.sql** has been successfully applied to the database on **October 16, 2025**.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Three-Tier Permission System

The RLS implementation provides three distinct permission levels:

#### **Tier 1: Full Admin**
- **Role:** `admin` or `full_admin`
- **Access:** Complete access to all database tables and records
- **Use Case:** System administrators, platform maintainers

#### **Tier 2: Moderator/Facilitator** 
- **Role:** `moderator` or `facilitator`
- **Access:** Full CRUD access to clients and projects they're members of, plus all related data
- **Use Case:** Project managers, workshop facilitators, team leads

#### **Tier 3: Regular Users**
- **Role:** `participant` and other roles
- **Access:** Limited to messages and insights in sessions they participate in
- **Use Case:** Workshop participants, survey respondents, team members

---

## Helper Functions Created

Six helper functions were created in the `public` schema to support RLS policies:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `public.is_full_admin()` | Checks if current user is a full admin |
| `public.is_moderator_or_facilitator()` | Checks if current user is a moderator/facilitator |
| `public.current_user_id()` | Returns the profile UUID of current user |
| `public.has_project_access(uuid)` | Checks if user is a member of specified project |
| `public.has_client_access(uuid)` | Checks if user has access to any project of specified client |
| `public.is_ask_participant(uuid)` | Checks if user is a participant in specified ask session |

---

## Tables Protected by RLS

All **18 tables** in the database now have Row Level Security enabled:

### Core Tables
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ clients
- ✅ projects
- ✅ project_members

### Challenge & Ask Tables
- ✅ challenges
- ✅ ask_sessions
- ✅ ask_participants

### Content Tables
- ✅ messages
- ✅ insights
- ✅ insight_authors
- ✅ insight_types

### Relationship Tables
- ✅ challenge_insights
- ✅ challenge_foundation_insights
- ✅ kpi_estimations

### AI & System Tables

- ✅ ai_model_configs
- ✅ ai_agent_logs
- ✅ ai_insight_jobs
- ✅ documents

## Migration Details

### Migration Number
`014_enable_rls_security.sql`

### What the Migration Does

1. **Drops Old Policies** - Removes simpler policies from migration 011
2. **Creates Helper Functions** - Six SECURITY DEFINER functions in `public` schema
3. **Enables RLS** - Activates Row Level Security on all 18 tables
4. **Creates Comprehensive Policies** - 80+ policies covering all access scenarios
5. **Adds Documentation** - Comment statements on all helper functions

### Key Technical Decisions

**Why `public` schema instead of `auth` schema?**
- Supabase restricts function creation in the `auth` schema
- `public` schema functions work identically for RLS policies
- `SECURITY DEFINER` ensures safe execution with proper permissions

**Why replace migration 011 policies?**
- Migration 011 had basic policies with limited role differentiation
- Migration 014 provides granular, role-based access control
- New system aligns with the three-tier permission model

---

## Security Features

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
Users only get the minimum access needed for their role.

### 2. Defense in Depth
- RLS enforced at database level
- Application-level validation still recommended
- Multiple policy layers for different operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### 3. Secure by Default
- No anonymous access (all policies require authentication)
- Service role bypasses RLS (use carefully in backend only)
- All helper functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` for consistent execution

### 4. Audit-Friendly
- All policies are named descriptively
- Helper functions are documented
- Clear role-based access model

---

## Testing the Implementation

### Quick Verification

```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('profiles', 'projects', 'messages', 'insights');

-- View all policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Test helper functions
SELECT public.is_full_admin();
SELECT public.current_user_id();
```

### Testing as Different Users

To properly test RLS, you need authenticated users with JWT tokens. The migration provides the foundation; testing requires:

1. **Create test users** with different roles (admin, moderator, participant)
2. **Authenticate** to get JWT tokens
3. **Execute queries** using authenticated Supabase client
4. **Verify** that users only see/modify data they should have access to

See `scripts/test-rls-policies.js` for a test framework (requires auth setup).

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Application Code Updates

Update your application to use the authenticated Supabase client for user requests:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Uses RLS
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);

// User is authenticated with JWT
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .select('*'); // RLS automatically filters results
```

```typescript
// ⚠️ Use sparingly: Bypasses RLS
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY // Service role bypasses RLS
);

// Only use for system operations, not user requests
```

### 2. User Role Assignment

Ensure users have appropriate roles in the `profiles` table:

```sql
-- Make user a full admin
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- Make user a moderator
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'moderator' 
WHERE email = 'moderator@example.com';

-- Add user to project
INSERT INTO project_members (project_id, user_id, role)
VALUES ('project-uuid', 'user-uuid', 'moderator');
```

### 3. Add Users to Ask Sessions

For regular users to participate in Ask sessions:

```sql
-- Add participant to ask session
INSERT INTO ask_participants (ask_session_id, user_id, role)
VALUES ('session-uuid', 'user-uuid', 'participant');
```

### 4. Monitor Performance

RLS policies can impact query performance. Monitor and optimize:

- Ensure foreign keys are indexed (already done in schema)
- Watch for slow queries involving policy checks
- Consider materialized views for complex permission lookups
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to debug slow queries

### 5. Regular Audits

Periodically review:
- User role assignments
- Project membership
- Policy effectiveness
- Access patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied for table X"

**Cause:** User doesn't have a matching RLS policy

**Solutions:**
1. Check user's role in `profiles` table
2. Verify user is in `project_members` for project-related tables
3. Verify user is in `ask_participants` for session-related tables
4. Check if you're using service role key (which bypasses RLS) when you should use anon key

### Issue: "Row level security is enabled but no policies exist"

**Cause:** RLS is on but no policies allow access

**Solution:**
- Admins should still have access
- Check if user is properly authenticated (`auth.uid()` returns a value)
- Verify policies exist: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'your_table';`

### Issue: Users can't see data they should be able to

**Cause:** Missing membership or participation records

**Solutions:**
1. Add user to `project_members` for project access
2. Add user to `ask_participants` for session access
3. Verify relationships are correctly established

### Issue: "Function public.is_full_admin() does not exist"

**Cause:** Migration 014 wasn't fully applied

**Solution:**
```bash
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node scripts/migrate.js up
```
